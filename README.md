Parallelization of Graph Algorithms

This project demonstrates the parallelization of Dijkstra's algorithm, a fundamental graph algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The repository compares the performance of sequential and parallel implementations using different thread counts and scheduling types (static and dynamic) in OpenMP.

Features

Sequential Dijkstra's Algorithm: Basic single-threaded implementation for benchmarking.
Parallel Dijkstra's Algorithm: Multi-threaded implementation using OpenMP.
Random Graph Generator: Generates random graphs with configurable vertex and edge counts.

Objectives

Compare the execution times of sequential and parallel implementations.
Test with varying numbers of threads and scheduling types.
Visualize performance improvements through graphs.
Promote the use of parallel graph algorithms for productivity enhancement in shortest path calculations.
